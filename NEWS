* Changes in Verilog::Language 2.213 9/5/2002

****	Support Cygwin (Windows) installations.  [Richard Dje]


* Changes in Verilog::Language 2.212 8/30/2002

***	Fix pin concatenations to not create false pins. [Kenneth Jiang]
	Concatenations are now just ignored; there is still no way to track
	pin interconnects where different bus bits end up interconnected
	differently.


* Changes in Verilog::Language 2.211 8/19/2002

***	If Verilog::Getopt list accessors are passed a reference,
	set the entire list to the reference, rather then adding a element.


* Changes in Verilog::Language 2.210 8/8/2002

****	Cleanups to support GNU Bison 1.35

****	Minor changes for SystemC support

* Changes in Verilog::Language 2.100 3/11/2002

	for new files.  [Joe Panec]

* Changes in Verilog::Language 1.15 10/25/2001

**	Added $assert_req_ack for checking simple handshakes.

**	Added --nostop, and made --stop be the default.
