Description
===========

   This package provides functions to support writing utilities that use
the Verilog language.  See `man Verilog::Language' and `man vrename'
after installation.

   Included is `vrename', a program for renaming signals, modules, and
parameters across many verilog files at once.

   Also included is `vpm' to convert macros that look like pli calls,
such as $info, into different Verilog code.  This enables programs like
Verilint and Synopsys dc_shell to ignore the macros (as they ignore pli
calls), but have the simulator do something special with them.

   For example:

           $info (0, "Welcome to a VPMed file\n");

   becomes

           ... $write ("[%0t] -I:example.v:0012: Welcome to a VPMed file\n",$time); ...

   where the filename and line number of the message have been added
along with the timestamp.
